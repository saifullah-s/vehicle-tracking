## Description  
A computer vision and deep learning project using YOLOv8 for vehicle detection and tracking, along with advanced post-processing techniques to estimate traffic volume on highways and intersections. The project utilizes the UA-DETRAC dataset (a benchmark dataset for multi-vehicle detection and tracking) and presents the processed traffic data on AWS for interactive visualization.  

The project focuses on fine-tuning the YOLOv8 model for optimal performance on vehicle detection, applying tracking algorithms to monitor vehicle movement, and analyzing traffic flow in different scenarios (highways and intersections).  

### Concepts:
